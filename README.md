# Ultrasonic-Obstruction-Avoiding-Robot
As the name suggests, the code here was written to power and control a movable robot that would be capable of detecting the obstacle in its path,
stop the vehicle,
put it in reverse motion.
Then use its Ultrasonic sensor ,mounted on a Servo motor to scan the area lying inside 180 degrees of angle to check for a free path.
If a safe enough distance is not found, it reverses the vehicle again and then scans the area again.
The system can be made more accurate by adding additional Ultrasonic sensors to scan a larger area and more motor to move and turn the vehicle at a larger angle.
Currently the system uses:
1 Arduino  UNO
1 L293D Motor Controller
2 300rpm Motors-2 Wheels
1 Servo Motor
1 Ultrasonic Sensor Mounted in the front
1 Power Bank
